This repository contains all the hands-on labs, code examples, and infrastructure templates used throughout the course.

## Course Structure

### Infrastructure Setup Approaches

This course covers three main approaches to setting up and managing EKS infrastructure:

#### 1. Manual Infrastructure Setup
- **EKS Cluster Creation**: Step-by-step cluster creation via AWS Console
- **Node Group Configuration**: Manual setup of worker nodes and auto-scaling groups
- **IAM Roles and Policies**: Creating and configuring required service roles
- **VPC and Networking**: Setting up networking components manually
- **Security Groups**: Configuring network security rules
- **Add-ons Installation**: Manual installation of essential cluster add-ons

#### 2. Terraform Infrastructure as Code
- **EKS Cluster Provisioning**: Automated cluster deployment using Terraform
- **Automated Node Group Deployment**: Infrastructure as code for worker nodes
- **Infrastructure State Management**: Managing Terraform state and resources
- **Resource Cleanup and Management**: Automated resource lifecycle management
- **Version Control**: Infrastructure versioning and change management
- **Modular Architecture**: Reusable Terraform modules for different environments

#### 3. Manual Steps & Operations
- **kubectl Configuration**: Setting up cluster access and authentication
- **Application Deployment Workflows**: Deploying applications to EKS
- **Service and Ingress Configuration**: Setting up load balancing and routing
- **Monitoring and Logging Setup**: Implementing observability solutions
- **Troubleshooting**: Common issues and resolution strategies
- **Best Practices**: Operational excellence and security practices
