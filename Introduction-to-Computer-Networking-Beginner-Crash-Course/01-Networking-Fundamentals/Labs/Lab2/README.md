# Lab 2: Network Topologies

## Objective
Understand different network topologies and their characteristics.

## Tasks

### Task 1: Topology Comparison
Create a comparison table with these topologies:
- Bus
- Star
- Ring
- Mesh

Include: Advantages, Disadvantages, Use Cases

### Task 2: Topology Design
Design a network topology for each scenario:

**Scenario A:** Small office with 10 computers
- Budget: Limited
- Reliability: Medium priority
- Easy troubleshooting: High priority

**Scenario B:** Data center with critical servers
- Budget: High
- Reliability: Critical
- Redundancy: Required

**Scenario C:** Home network
- Budget: Low
- Reliability: Medium
- Ease of setup: High priority

### Task 3: Failure Analysis
For each topology, describe what happens when:
1. One device fails
2. The central connection point fails (if applicable)
3. One cable is cut

## Expected Outcomes
- Identify appropriate topology for different scenarios
- Understand trade-offs between topologies
- Recognize single points of failure
