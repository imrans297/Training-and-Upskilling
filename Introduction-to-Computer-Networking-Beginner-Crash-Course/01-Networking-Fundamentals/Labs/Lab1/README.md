# Lab 1: Identifying Network Devices

## Objective
Learn to identify different network devices and understand their functions.

## Scenario
You're setting up a small office network. Identify which devices you need and their purposes.

## Tasks

### Task 1: Device Identification
Match each device with its correct description:

1. Hub
2. Switch
3. Router
4. Modem
5. Firewall

**Descriptions:**
- A) Connects your network to the Internet
- B) Forwards data only to the intended recipient using MAC addresses
- C) Broadcasts data to all connected devices
- D) Routes traffic between different networks using IP addresses
- E) Filters network traffic based on security rules

### Task 2: Network Diagram
Draw a simple home network showing:
- Internet connection
- Modem
- Router
- Switch (optional)
- 3 wired devices
- 2 wireless devices

### Task 3: Real-World Application
Answer these questions:
1. Why are hubs rarely used in modern networks?
2. What's the difference between a switch and a router?
3. When would you need a separate modem and router vs. a combined device?

## Expected Outcomes
- Understand the role of each network device
- Know when to use each device type
- Recognize device hierarchy in networks

**Task 1:**
1. Hub - C
2. Switch - B
3. Router - D
4. Modem - A
5. Firewall - E

**Task 3:**
1. Hubs cause collisions and broadcast to all ports, reducing network efficiency
2. Switch operates at Layer 2 (MAC), Router at Layer 3 (IP); Router connects different networks
3. Separate devices offer more control and features; combined is simpler for home use
