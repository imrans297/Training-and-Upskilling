# Lab 1: Security Threats and Attack Identification

## Objective
Identify common network security threats and attack types.

## Tasks

### Task 1: Threat Classification
Classify each scenario as the appropriate attack type:

1. User receives email claiming to be from bank asking for password
2. Website becomes unavailable due to massive traffic from multiple sources
3. Attacker intercepts WiFi traffic at coffee shop
4. Malicious code encrypts files and demands payment
5. Attacker tries every possible password combination
6. Malicious script injected into website steals session cookies

**Attack Types:** Phishing, DDoS, MITM, Ransomware, Brute Force, XSS

### Task 2: Security Assessment
For each scenario, identify vulnerabilities:

**Scenario A:** Small office network
- Default router password
- No firewall
- Shared WiFi password on sticky note
- No antivirus software

List vulnerabilities and risks.

**Scenario B:** Web application
- No input validation
- Passwords stored in plain text
- No HTTPS
- SQL queries built from user input

List vulnerabilities and potential attacks.

### Task 3: Attack Prevention
For each attack, suggest prevention methods:

1. **Phishing:**
   - Prevention: ?
   - Detection: ?

2. **DDoS:**
   - Prevention: ?
   - Mitigation: ?

3. **MITM:**
   - Prevention: ?
   - Detection: ?

4. **Brute Force:**
   - Prevention: ?
   - Detection: ?

### Task 4: Incident Response
**Scenario:** You suspect a computer is infected with malware.

Response steps:
1. ?
2. ?
3. ?
4. ?
5. ?

## Expected Outcomes
- Identify common security threats
- Assess security vulnerabilities
- Recommend prevention measures
- Develop incident response procedures

**Task 1:**
1. Phishing, 2. DDoS, 3. MITM, 4. Ransomware, 5. Brute Force, 6. XSS

**Task 2 - Scenario A:**
- Default password: Easy unauthorized access
- No firewall: No traffic filtering
- Exposed WiFi password: Unauthorized network access
- No antivirus: Malware infections

**Task 3:**
1. Phishing: User training, email filtering, verify sender
2. DDoS: Rate limiting, CDN, traffic filtering
3. MITM: Use VPN, HTTPS, avoid public WiFi
4. Brute Force: Strong passwords, account lockout, MFA

**Task 4:**
1. Isolate computer from network
2. Document symptoms and behavior
3. Run antivirus/malware scan
4. Remove malware or reimage system
5. Change passwords, monitor for further issues
