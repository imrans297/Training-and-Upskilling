## StatefulSets
- Ordered pod deployment
- Stable network identities
- Persistent storage per pod
- Use: Databases, stateful apps

## DaemonSets
- One pod per node
- Automatic scheduling on new nodes
- Use: Logging, monitoring agents

## Jobs
- Run to completion
- Batch processing
- One-time tasks

## CronJobs
- Scheduled jobs
- Periodic tasks
- Time-based execution

## Ingress
- HTTP/HTTPS routing
- Load balancing
- SSL termination
- Name-based virtual hosting

## Network Policies
- Pod-to-pod traffic control
- Namespace isolation
- Ingress/egress rules

## Resource Limits
- CPU/Memory requests
- CPU/Memory limits
- Quality of Service (QoS)

## Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)
- Automatic scaling based on metrics
- CPU/Memory utilization
- Custom metrics

## RBAC
- Role-Based Access Control
- Users, groups, service accounts
- Roles and ClusterRoles
- RoleBindings and ClusterRoleBindings
